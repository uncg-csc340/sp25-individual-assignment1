I am a lecturer of Computer Science. I have an MS in Comp Sci from UNCG, and a BS in Computer Science
from Indiana University of Pennsylvania. I like (some) superheroes and puzzles.
Just like most basic people, I like hiking. I also like history tidbits (ask me about my favorite
podcasts). I'm currently reading Medium Raw by uncle Tony (Bourdain).
This is the way.

Nandor DeLaurentis
---------------------------------------------------------
I was a very ferocious warrior in the Ottoman Empire, which meant doing a lot of things. A lot
of pillaging. People would say 'hey please don’t pillage me' and I would say 'nooooo, I’m
pillaging everyone, you included'. I was relentless. They would call me Nandor The Relentless.
Because I just never relent.

I am a Senior at UNCG and also work for Apple as a College advisor.  I live a super boring life.
Because of that, I can really easily chronicle my every day here; I wake up at 6 in the morning,
make an egg-white omelette, go to the gym, then to classes, I get home and eat an amalgamation of
lunch/dinner, appropriately coined: 'Linner', then work until 11 PM EST.  If my friends are up, we play
Valorant or R6S to make my night worse; I then play until I'm tilted and have to sleep.  Then I repeat.
